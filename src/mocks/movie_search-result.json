Kohei's first case starts out simple enough. The suspect, a blonde-haired security guard, had already confessed to manslaughter, but he suddenly retracts his confession and takes things to court with big-shot defense attorney Gamo (Matsumoto Koshiro). It turns out that the security guard is a key alibi witness in a high-profile political corruption case, and the results of his case will directly affect the next.  With the media, politicians, and a special investigative team breathing down his back, Kohei must handle the case with care (and flair) to find out the truth.",

            "overview": "This is about a Little League coach Joe Finn, whose pursuit of fame and fortune leaves him with little but broken relationships-particularly with his son. Determined to win back his son and reunite other kids with their own all-too-absent fathers, Joe starts a new father-son baseball league. Dads are required to practice daily with their sons. Teams must follow \"Joe's Rules\" for baseball: players can lead off, no mandatory rotations, no ties, and games are played a full 9 innings or more. With only half a season left to produce a winning team, Joe's return to the purity of the game begins to transform everything, from Joe's own heart, to local prison inmates, to fathers and sons in neighboring towns... all because every boy needs a HERO.",
